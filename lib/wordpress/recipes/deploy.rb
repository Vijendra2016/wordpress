namespace :deploy do
  desc <<-DESC
    Copies your project and updates the symlink. It does this in a \
    transaction, so that if either `update_code' or `symlink' fail, all \
    changes made to the remote servers will be rolled back, leaving your \
    system in the same state it was in before `update' was invoked.
  DESC
  task :default do
    transaction do
      update_code
      symlink
    end
  end

  desc <<-DESC
    Prepares one or more servers for deployment. Before you can use any \
    of the Capistrano deployment tasks with your project, you will need to \
    make sure all of your servers have been prepared with `cap deploy:setup'. When \
    you add a new server to your cluster, you can easily run the setup task \
    on just that server by specifying the HOSTS environment variable:

      $ cap HOSTS=new.server.com deploy:setup

    It is safe to run this task on servers that have already been set up; it \
    will not destroy any deployed revisions or data.
  DESC
  task :setup, :except => { :no_release => true } do
    dirs = [deploy_to, releases_path, shared_path]
    dirs += %w(uploads).map { |d| File.join(shared_path, d) }
    run "umask 02 && mkdir -p #{dirs.join(' ')}"
  end

  desc <<-DESC
    [internal] Copies your project to the remote servers. This is the first stage \
    of any deployment; moving your updated code and assets to the deployment \
    servers. You will rarely call this task directly, however; instead, you \
    should call the `deploy' task (to do a complete deploy) or the `update' \
    task (if you want to perform the `restart' task separately).

    You will need to make sure you set the :scm variable to the source \
    control software you are using (it defaults to :subversion), and the \
    :deploy_via variable to the strategy you want to use to deploy (it \
    defaults to :checkout).
  DESC
  task :update_code, :except => { :no_release => true } do
    on_rollback { run "rm -rf #{release_path}; true" }
    strategy.deploy!
    finalize_update
  end

  desc <<-DESC
    [internal] Touches up the released code. This is called by update_code \
    after the basic deploy finishes.

    This task will make the release group-writable (if the :group_writable \
    variable is set to true, which is the default). It will then set up \
    symlinks to the shared directory for the uploads directory.
  DESC
  task :finalize_update, :except => { :no_release => true } do
    run "chmod -R g+w #{latest_release}" if fetch(:group_writable, true)

    run <<-CMD
      rm -rf #{latest_release}/public/wp-content/uploads &&
      ln -s #{shared_path}/uploads #{latest_release}/public/wp-content/uploads
    CMD
  end

  desc <<-DESC
    [internal] Updates the symlink to the most recently deployed version. Capistrano works \
    by putting each new release of your application in its own directory. When \
    you deploy a new version, this task's job is to update the `current' symlink \
    to point at the new version. You will rarely need to call this task \
    directly; instead, use the `deploy' task (which performs a complete \
    deploy, including `restart') or the 'update' task (which does everything \
    except `restart').
  DESC
  task :symlink, :except => { :no_release => true } do
    on_rollback { run "rm -f #{current_path}; ln -s #{previous_release} #{current_path}; true" }
    run "rm -f #{current_path} && ln -s #{latest_release} #{current_path}"
  end

  desc <<-DESC
    Rolls back to a previous version. This is handy if you ever \
    discover that you've deployed a lemon; `cap rollback' and you're right \
    back where you were, on the previously deployed version.
  DESC
  task :rollback do
    if releases.length < 2
      abort "could not rollback the code because there is no prior release"
    else
      run "rm #{current_path}; ln -s #{previous_release} #{current_path} && rm -rf #{current_release}"
    end
  end

  desc <<-DESC
    Clean up old releases. By default, the last 5 releases are kept on each \
    server (though you can change this with the keep_releases variable). All \
    other deployed revisions are removed from the servers. By default, this \
    will use sudo to clean up the old releases, but if sudo is not available \
    for your environment, set the :use_sudo variable to false instead.
  DESC
  task :cleanup, :except => { :no_release => true } do
    count = fetch(:keep_releases, 5).to_i
    if count >= releases.length
      logger.important "no old releases to clean up"
    else
      logger.info "keeping #{count} of #{releases.length} deployed releases"

      directories = (releases - releases.last(count)).map { |release|
        File.join(releases_path, release) }.join(" ")

      invoke_command "rm -rf #{directories}", :via => run_method
    end
  end

  namespace :pending do
    desc <<-DESC
      Displays the `diff' since your last deploy. This is useful if you want \
      to examine what changes are about to be deployed. Note that this might \
      not be supported on all SCM's.
    DESC
    task :diff, :except => { :no_release => true } do
      system(source.local.diff(current_revision))
    end

    desc <<-DESC
      Displays the commits since your last deploy. This is good for a summary \
      of the changes that have occurred since the last deploy. Note that this \
      might not be supported on all SCM's.
    DESC
    task :default, :except => { :no_release => true } do
